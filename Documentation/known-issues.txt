Known Issues
==================

1. Transport layer address in asn1 spec is modified to OCTET from BITSTRING as a workaround, as the asn1tools=0.137.4  is encoding the transport layer data with extra bits,when specified as BITSTRING.
2. When Ignite is started in non kubernetes environment and while MME is running in docker, then GRPC validation in ROBO TC needs to be commented, before execution.
3. Security Support is partial. Ciphering is not supported. For intergrity protection of UL NAS message, SNOW_3G algorithm is used. Validation of MAC of DL NAS messages is currently not supported.
